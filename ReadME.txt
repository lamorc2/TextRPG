
Project Overview:

	This is a console-based text RPG created almost entirely from scratch within C++ as a personal project to practice:

	 -Object Oriented Design vs. Data Driven Design
	 -C++ Architecture 
	 -Inventory/Item Systems
	 -Turn-Based Combat Structure
	 -Save/Load File Handling


Motivations:

	I created this project to 

	-Practice/Reinforce advanced C++ class design and memory management
	-Explore basic game design architecture such as data driven design, as well as ECS fundementals
	-Build a portfolio piece showcasing game systems programmming skills outside coursework



Key Features:

	Player & Inventory System

		Player class with dynamic attributes (HP, mana, stats)

		Inventory with stackable items tracked via InventoryEntry structs

		Unique Items with type-based effects (weapons, armor, consumables)

	Turn-Based Combat System

		Enemies with condition-based decision making

		Data-driven action system with type enums and planned lambda evaluation

	Map & Navigation

		OOP location-based navigation system with directional connectivity

		(Planned) Dynamic events and interactions per location

	Save/Load System

		(In development) Save files storing player stats, inventory IDs, and location data

		Planned unordered_map database for item initialization

	Debug Logging System

		(In development) Global debug log to track game events, used for testing and analysis
